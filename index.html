<h1> Distribution </h1>    
<p1>
    Distrubution is not the typical distrubution we think about like giving out different objects when there is a surplus. Instead, this type of distrubution refers to data and the way we manipulate it to display certain types of information. It shows a listing a function of all the possible functions of the data. With that said, there are 4 elements of distribution and they are level, spread, shape, and outliers.
    </p1>   
    <h2> Level </h2>
    <p1>
    Levels are measures of central tendency. They present things like the mean, and other important data points. 
    </p1>
    <h2> Spread </h2>
    <p1> This refers to how the points are spread on the graph. This a bad definition, but the points are all seperated by a certain amount and the distance between each data point would be a spread. This would include standard deviation.
    </p1>
    <h2> Shape </h2>
    <p1> Shape is the way the way the data displayed is shown to the user. This includes the different types of graphs used to display the distribution.</p1>
    <h2> Outliers </h2>
    <p1> Outliers are any point in the data that is far away from the data set. These data points affect the mean and ranges of the data set, and seem sort of out of place when they are on they are compared with the other points. </p1>
